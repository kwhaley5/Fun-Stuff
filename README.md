### Todo.html

This is a simple todo list that runs fast and lets you spit out your thoughts quickly. The document opens with `textarea` and `button` to add your to do list. 
Once the `add` button is clicked, whatever is typed into the `textarea` will be submited in a `ul`, along with a `remove button`
On each click of the `add` or `remove button`, local storage is called to save the todo list, so you can close the browser and keep everything saved
